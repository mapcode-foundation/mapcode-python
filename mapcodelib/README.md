# Mapcode module for Python

Copyright (C) 2014-2015 Stichting Mapcode Foundation (http://www.mapcode.com)

----

This Python project contains a module to encode latitude/longitude pairs to mapcodes
and to decode mapcodes back to latitude/longitude pairs.

If you wish to use mapcodes in your own application landscape, consider using running an instance of the
Mapcode REST API, which can be found on: **https://github.com/mapcode-foundation/mapcode-rest-service**
